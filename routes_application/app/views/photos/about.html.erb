<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>In addition to resource routing, Rails has powerful support for routing arbitrary URLs to actions. Here, you don't get groups of routes automatically generated by resourceful routing. Instead, you set up each route separately within your application.

  While you should usually use resourceful routing, there are still many places where the simpler routing is more appropriate. There's no need to try to shoehorn every last piece of your application into a resourceful framework if that's not a good fit.
  
  In particular, simple routing makes it very easy to map legacy URLs to new Rails actions.</p>
