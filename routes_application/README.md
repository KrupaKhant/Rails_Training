1) Difference between collection route and member route. 
=> Collection routes and member routes are two types of routes in Rails. A collection route acts on a collection of resources, while a member route acts on a specific resource. For example, if you have a posts resource, a collection route could be /posts/archive, which archives all the posts, while a member route could be /posts/1/edit, which edits the post with the ID of 1. And also member routes is used to show perticular item with id at that time also member is used.
